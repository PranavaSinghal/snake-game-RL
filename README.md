# Project for IITB Summer of Code 2021 - Snake AI

## Building the classic snake game using python pygame and making it intelligent with reinforcement learning

### Stage 1
Making a basic snake game, no reinforcement learning involved. The _objective_ is to collect as many apples as possible without making the snake crash into the walls or itself. The _game controls_ are the arrow keys.

I've recreated the snake game by Clear Code which you can find [on GitHub, here](github.com/clear-code-projects/Snake) and [on his YouTube channel, here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU)

### Stage 2
Implementing the value iteration algorithm to solve MDPs and formulating a maze as an MDP (the current implementation is quite ineffcient and memory heavy but is logically correct). This is a solution to this [project](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2020/pa-2/programming-assignment-2.html)
