# Project for IITB Summer of Code 2021 - Snake AI

## Building the classic snake game using python pygame and making it intelligent with reinforcement learning

As of now, the project is in its initial stages with only a basic snake game, no reinforcement learning involved. The _objective_ is to collect as many apples as possible without making the snake crash into the walls or itself. The _game controls_ are the arrow keys.

I've recreated the snake game by Clear Code which you can find on GitHub, [here](github.com/clear-code-projects/Snake) and on his YouTube channel, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU)
