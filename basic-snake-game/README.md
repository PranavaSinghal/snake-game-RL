# Snake game with python Pygame

This is an implementation of the classic snake game.
- The __objective__ is to collect as many apples as possible without making the snake crash into the walls or into itself. in the event of a crash with either of these the snake dies.
- The __game controls__ are the arrow keys up, down, left and right. Unless you click an arrow key to change the direction the snake continues to move in its previous direction.
- When the snake dies the game score is __reset__ and the snake is restored to its initial configuration.
- In order to __exit__ the program close the pygame window.

### Playing the game
1) navigate to this folder using
~~~
cd basic-snake-game
~~~
2) simply run the file snake.py
~~~
python snake.py
~~~
3) A game window pops up with the snake at rest in its initial position and a score of zero. Click any of the arrow keys to start playing.
